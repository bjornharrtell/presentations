# What is GitHub

* Centralized git and associated project management
* Launched 2008 rapid growth from ~2010
* Bought by Microsoft in 2018 (yay!)
* Takes one of the best things with Git (distributed versioning) and makes it centralized (yay!)

---

# Why do we use GitHub?

* Centralized versioned storage/management of (mostly) text and code
* One of two places that we have blessed with proper backup of what we produce (the other one is Google Drive)
* Simple issue tracking (aka. poor mans project management)
* Project management ("larger" projects)

---

# Will GitHub help me use Git properly?

## For example:

* Branch strategies
* Merge conflict resolution
* Rebasing

## Answer:

* No.
* Use an editor/IDE with good git and possibly GitHub integration
* Do not use GitHub plain in browser UI for git stuff

---

# What do we not use at Github?

* Wiki
* Git LFS (large file storage)
* GitHub Actions (we use CircleCI)

---

# Best practices

* Keep it simple
* Use branch protection
* Use issues + pull requests

## If project isn't exceptionally large

* One repository
* Simple issue tracking (no project management)
* Project name = system name = host name (if applicable)
